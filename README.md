Banque de Livres Usagés (BLU)

## Introduction
This program allows to run a used books sell. It handles an inventory of books and other school items as well as a member system with money return, student-parent discounts and reservations.


## About the BLU
This project started to refresh the current, but outdated, system in place at my college for our used book sell. At the beginning of each semester students can come and drop their old books to sell them. All the money is given back to the students who sold the books. This is a great way to recycle books and to diminish the costs of higher education.

For more information on the BLU, please refer to the [Student Council (AÉCS) website](http://aecs.info)
